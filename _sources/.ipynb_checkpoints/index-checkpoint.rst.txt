Welcome to TandemMod's documentation!
==================================

TandemMod is a deep learning framework for detecting RNA modifications in nanopore direct RNA sequencing (DRS) data. It offers three modes: de novo training, transfer learning, and prediction. Researchers can train from scratch, fine-tune pre-trained models, or apply existing models for predictions. TandemMod achieves high accuracy and can be used to identify multi tpyes of RNA modifications in various species and conditions. It provides a user-friendly solution for studying RNA modifications.

To use TandemMod, you can follow the instructions below:
